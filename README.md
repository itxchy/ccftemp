HTML5 Boilerplate with Gulp and BrowserSync ready for you. No fuss. Just start coding!

1. npm install
2. gulp serve

That's it! Barebones, simple. 

This will give you HTML5 Boilerplate, along with Gulp running things, and BrowserSync creating a server and refreshing the browser for you. 

I made this repo so that I can hit the ground running with a new web project. I'm still new at this.
